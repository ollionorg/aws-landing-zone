# Contributing Guide

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üôåüéâüëç

This project is a community effort, and everyone is welcome to contribute.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [lzhelp@ollion.com](mailto:lzhelp@ollion.com).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check [here](https://github.com/ollionorg/aws-landing-zone/issues) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to this project? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
